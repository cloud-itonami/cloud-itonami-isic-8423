  "PublicSafetyActor — the ISIC Rev.5 8423 public order and safety
  administrative operations actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  administrative operation request (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals).
  No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted
  run can resume after human sign-off.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit           (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the PublicSafetyAdvisor can never directly
  commit a record or dispatch an action the PublicSafetyGovernor refuses —
  every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`. Additionally, any
  proposal touching arrest, use-of-force, investigation, evidence handling,
  tactical dispatch, or enforcement authority PERMANENTLY HOLDS (no path to
  approval)."
